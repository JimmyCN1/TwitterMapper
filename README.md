# Twitter Mapper
## This repository contains the final project from software construction - object oriented design course provided by UBC University.

The project incorporates the twitter api to allow the user to query a specific string. The program will then display to the user the location and profile picture of every tweet tweeted since then that contains the query string on a world map. The user will be able to hover over the profile picture on the map to be able to view a short preview of the tweet.

This project makes use of the Java swingFx and the iterable and observer design patterns while focusing on incapsulated and cohesive object oriented design.
